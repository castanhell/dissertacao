For many optimization problems actually seen, find the optimatial solution remains intractable, this because we do not know polynomial time algorithms for such problems. Aware of this limitation, we can sacrifice optimality (for a known value) \cite{Vignatti} and apply a tractable solution, something we call Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (PTAS). In this work we will see definitions on what are Poliynomial Time Aproximation Schemes and some algorithms created from this idea to solve four problems: The knapsack Problem, Scheduling jobs on identical parallel machines, Bin--packing and the Euclidean traveling salesman problem. We also present our future work, which we choose to study algorithms for unit disk graphs, in special  \cite{li}, where a PTAS was recently discovered for the Weighted Unit Disk Cover Problem.
